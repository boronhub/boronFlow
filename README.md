A collection of my work for TensorFlow during GCI 2019

I chose TensorFlow as my organization for Google Code-In 2019. It has been a great experience working for an organization that I have a genuine interest in. I got to work on innovative and new tasks, and practice my open source skills. Contributing to TensorFlow, be it through adding documentation, reviewing other's PRs, or identifying and fixing various bugs, has been wonderful. My favorite task was definitely contributing to [SwiftPlot](https://github.com/KarthikRIyer/swiftplot), a data visualization library based on Swift for TensorFlow created as a GSoC 2019 project by [KarhtikRIyer](https://github.com/KarthikRIyer). It was nice to work on such a new project, and I will surely keep contributing to it. The mentors were very helpful, and I would like to thank them from the bottom of my heart for all the feedback and advice they gave.

## Projects

 - [Eldr](https://github.com/boronhub/eldr) :  An app for the elderly to make their life easier. It utilizes Image Classification with TFLite.
 - [Autoencoder](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14O4ARBJllu6VS6Cd5WuHZF4mxbjJyYX0):  A simple autoencoder with tf.keras
 - [Image Classifier](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1D54sG6RWNpCboNGb99cHalzWoE4_Pkxb):  An image classifier using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
 - [Custom ProgBar]([https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17Zd37hS_jgSqP3b8iC1947PMrE0zNNDf](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17Zd37hS_jgSqP3b8iC1947PMrE0zNNDf)): Tracks various training parameters, and uploads to TensorBoard
 - [Background Remover]([https://github.com/boronhub/bg-remover](https://github.com/boronhub/bg-remover)): 100 layers tiramisu model trained on CamVid dataset 
 - [Breast Cancer Classifier](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YcS3K-0J9vIuTBflXFmSZqm722KnvgyD): Based on [this](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer) dataset

Now that GCI 2019 has come to an end, I see the evident need for a platform for beginners to interact and learn from each other. This was many participant's first interaction with TensorFlow, or even open source in general, and I feel that a SIG or a Google Group would add to a sense of community, and make it much easier on them to interact with new developers as well as mentors that can enhance their knowledge of TensorFlow. This SIG can also include an IRC/Slack channel for integration with Github. This SIG will be of great help, especially in competitions like GCI and GSoC. It can also serve as the breeding ground for exciting new ideas for TensorFlow. I have created a PR for this over at [https://github.com/tensorflow/community/pull/198](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/pull/198) , and I request all those interested in this to please show their support. Thanks!
